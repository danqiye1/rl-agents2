# Reinforcement Learning Agents

I hope that this repository will be my personal framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning in future. Of course this remains to be seen.

## Current WIP:
1. Deep Q Learning on Atari Breakout.

## To Do:
0. Breakout gets stuck if the action is not fire.
1. Concatenate history of 4 frames (Implemented by Gym default)
2. Implement max steps for evaluation (Implemented)
3. Implement decaying epsilon
4. Use Kaiming Initialization (Implemented)
5. Implement checkpoints to save agents and models.
